# [Redux Memory Game](http://mauricius.github.io/redux-memory-game)

Redux implementation of a memory game.

## Redux

[Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux) is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps, written by [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov)

It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as [live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools).

### Influences

The game is heavily inspired by the [Redux examples](https://github.com/rackt/redux/tree/master/examples) and it's just a proof of concept on how Redux works.

### Run the game

```
git clone https://github.com/mauricius/redux-memory-game .
npm install
npm start
```
